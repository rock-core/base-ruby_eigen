This gem provides bindings for the
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) linear algebra
library. They are quite limited, to the methods / functionality that were
needed. Functionality gets added as it goes, there is no goal to have a 100%
coverage of the Eigen functionality.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'eigen'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install eigen

## Usage

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
